This folder contains the game variant that places more than one food at once, and the corresonding agent.

Tasks:
1. Take into account both foods, now only collects one of them, and most cases can't even develop during the learning process (maybe states).

Ideas:
1. Give different reward to foods, if the snake catches one place a new food then swap values.
