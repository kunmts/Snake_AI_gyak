Within a university project we train AI to play three slightly different versions of the game Snake.

General high priority todo list:
1. Learn how the model, the agent, and the Pytorch works (fully understand the current code).
2. Give the snake more sense about it's body position, to prevent self collision and avoid going into circles (valid in all variants). - Store previous steps (decisions) in a list then choose the next one according to those.
3. Somehow manage to create multiple games at once and select the best one to store, it would be nice if we could display it.

If we have plenty of time after the completion of all other tasks:
1. Create two snakes in one game and make them compete against each other.

Additional and specific ideas can be found in the corresponding folders.
