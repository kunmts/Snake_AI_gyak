This folder contains the models we use for optimization, and a file that displays some information about the current case.

Tasks: (Requires a more detailed explanation, probably this will be the next and most important step)
1. Implement as much models as we can and compare them.
2. Non-ML techniques.
3. Genetic algorithms.
4. Reinforcement learning.
